# DESTINATION: DEEP SPACE
Team 5053 starts the 2019 FRC season with no experienced programmers.  We will be developing a command robot using the FRC Robot Builder and FRC VS Code provided by WPILib.

## IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT NOTES
If you use robot builder and export java, you must modify the following files:
OI.java (comment out the auto-generated code for operateArm commands to the SmartDashboard)
clawOpenAndEjectCargo.java (comment out the auto-generated add commands)
operateArm.java (comment out the auto-generated add commands)
